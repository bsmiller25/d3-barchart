d3-barchart
===========

Code for a D3 bar chart that reads data from a csv.  Can switch between stacked and grouped. Can change the time scale.  Can swap out displayed bars.

This code is slightly modified from code I wrote as a US Government employee on official time and is therefore in the public domain.
